# Todo-List
## Django Practice

- I decided to practice some simple Django/Python application creation by following along with a talented developer's video on YouTube. He step by step explained his process as he made a todo list with authentication and MVC functionality.

## Reflection
---

- The jump from React to Django is definitely interesting. Working with React for 6 months gave me a false sense of understanding. It took some time to understand the differences and how to get similar functionality out of Django like I have with React but I eventually understood. I need more practice but it was refreshing to be challenged with something new. I'm going to return to the MERN stack and create something from the ground up to refresh myself on the technologies. I switched off to Python3 for a while and I feel I need the JavaScript/TypeScript practice.
